3. Filter out weak evidence (e.g., ordinary professional certifications for Membership)
4. Combine related evidence into cohesive arguments within each standard
5. Follow the argumentation structure specified for each standard
6. CRITICAL DISTINCTION — Published Material (iii) vs Scholarly Articles (vi):
   - (iii) Published Material = media coverage ABOUT the alien by others
