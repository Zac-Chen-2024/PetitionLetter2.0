Ms. Qu's membership was granted only after a formal application and review process, as detailed in the Association's implementation guidelines [Exhibit C2, p.2]. This membership is reserved for senior professionals who have devoted many years to their specialty, and her admission was personally reviewed and certified by the Association's Vice President and other top experts [Exhibit C2, p.3]. The Association is a significant industry body that provides critical services to its members, including market information, technology consultation, and legal aid [Exhibit C4, p.2]. It holds substantial authority, as it formulates industry quality specifications, service standards, and participates in product standard development, demonstrating its role in setting professional benchmarks [Exhibit C4, p.3]. Its formal governance structure, including a Council elected through a re-election meeting, further underscores its established and authoritative status within the field [Exhibit C5, p.2]. The Association's leadership includes individuals of the highest caliber, such as Ping Zhang, a champion athlete widely recognized for winning the first gold medal for China in the Asian Bodybuilding and Fitness Championships and for holding the most gold medals [Exhibit C6, p.2]. Therefore, Ms. Qu's membership in this selective, authoritative, and elite organization, which admits only those with demonstrated senior-level accomplishments, clearly meets the regulatory standard for associations requiring outstanding achievements of their members.",

The Jakarta Post represents a major media institution in Indonesia, founded in 1983 as a unique milestone in the nation's media publishing history [Exhibit D2, p.2]. It was established as a daily English-language newspaper headquartered in Jakarta, owned by PT Bina Media Tenggara [Exhibit D3, p.4]. The publication's journalistic excellence is confirmed by its receipt of prestigious awards, including the Adam Malik award, which its journalists have won multiple times. Specifically, The Jakarta Post earned top honors for its investigative report on unrest in Wamena, Papua, in September 2019, along with a bronze award for its print edition coverage of the 2019 presidential election [Exhibit D4, p.5]. The Paper (\u6f8e\u6e43\u65b0\u95fb) holds significant media authority as a digital publication overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, distinguishing it from other new media challengers [Exhibit D12, p.2]. It possesses Class I Qualification for Internet News Information Service and Audio Video Service, representing China's first product to undergo complete transformation from traditional to new media [Exhibit D13, p.2]. The Paper's excellence is further evidenced by its receipt of over 400 domestic and international awards and honors from 2018 to 2023, including the China Journalism Award and SND Best of Digital Design. As a new media success story, The Paper covers contentious issues including official corruption and public health scandals, demonstrating its influence in China's fast-changing news marketplace [Exhibit D12, p.2]. Its coverage includes substantive interviews with industry figures such as Qu Yaruo, founder of Venus Weightlifting Club, discussing China's Olympic weightlifting prowess [Exhibit D9, p.3]. China Sports Daily (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f53\u80b2\u62a5) enjoys national recognition and prestige, having been named multiple times among the \"Top Ten Most Beloved Newspapers\" and \"Top Ten Influential Media Brands in China\" in national selection activities [Exhibit D6, p.3]. The publication maintains official status and substantial circulation reach, having survived major reforms in the 1990s that expanded China's sports journal market from a few publications to more than forty [Exhibit D7, p.2]. China Sports Daily's editorial mission is to provide comprehensive, multidimensional coverage of Chinese and global sports through timely, authoritative, vivid, and rich news reports [Exhibit D6, p.3]. Collectively, this evidence establishes that the Beneficiary's work has been featured in major media with national and international circulation, thereby satisfying the regulatory criterion at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7204.5(h)(3)(iii).",

This system, which reflects a deep concern for athlete health and incorporates innovative methods for body alignment and injury prevention, has proven effective, as demonstrated by its application in reducing knee injuries among athletes [Exhibit B3, p.2; Exhibit B5, p.3]. The major significance of these contributions is evidenced by their international reach and endorsement by elite figures in the sport, including the training of Olympic medalists and the delivery of her system in over 50 countries [Exhibit A1, p.2; Exhibit B1, p.2]. Her holistic approach, guided by the philosophy \"Human before athlete,\" has had a profound impact worldwide and earned recommendations from Olympic champions and federation presidents [Exhibit B2, p.3; Exhibit B3, p.2]. The Beneficiary pioneered the amateur weightlifting movement in China by founding the nation's first amateur Olympic weightlifting club, which successfully filled a critical gap in the domestic sports landscape [Exhibit B4, p.2]. This club organizes the high-level ALL Stars Weightlifting competition, an event recognized for reaching international standards in scale and professionalism, thereby popularizing the sport at the grassroots level [Exhibit B3, p.2; Exhibit B4, p.3].

    content: "The record demonstrates that the Beneficiary has satisfied the regulatory criterion at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7204.5(h)(3)(viii) by performing in a leading or critical role for distinguished organizations. The Beneficiary established foundational leadership and vision as the founder of Venus Weightlifting Club, where she established China's first Olympic weightlifting club and promoted the discipline in the general fitness market [Exhibit A-1]. Her foundational role is further confirmed by a letter of recommendation which states she possesses the drive to continue making significant contributions to the global weightlifting community [Exhibit B-2]. Under her leadership, the organization achieved significant international impact, including organizing a successful international training camp in Shanghai for athletes from various provinces [Exhibit B-1]. A collaborator noted the Beneficiary's extraordinary foresight and executive force, which ensured the professionalism and high standards of their cooperative project [Exhibit B-3], and she developed systematic training systems that advanced the popularization of amateur weightlifting [Exhibit B-4]. This global influence is formally documented through a Sponsorship Agreement entered into by the Club, demonstrating her capacity to secure strategic international partnerships [Exhibit F-2]. The Beneficiary's formal legal authority and ownership of Venus Weightlifting Club is conclusively established by official corporate documentation identifying her as the legal representative and shareholder [Exhibit F-1]. The Beneficiary also holds a critical role as a Shareholder, Founder, and Head Coach at ISHTAR HEALTH PTE. LTD., where she played a crucial role in the company's training programs, as confirmed by an official company letter [Exhibit F-6]. In this capacity, she has been instrumental in expanding the company's professional network by establishing relationships with international partners, demonstrating her critical impact on the organization's strategic direction [Exhibit F-6]. Therefore, the Beneficiary's documented roles as the founder, legal representative, and driving strategic force for these organizations unequivocally meet the regulatory standard for performing in a leading or critical capacity.",
