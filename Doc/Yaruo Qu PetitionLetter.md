She is among the small percentage who have risen to the very top of weightlifting training and has sustained national and international acclaim and recognition.

### III. Ms. Qu's Original Contributions of Major Significance to the Weightlifting Training Industry

After discovering her passion for weightlifting during her time abroad, Ms. Yaruo Qu returned to China with a vision to fill a noticeable gap in the domestic market. She founded China's first weightlifting club - Venus Weightlifting Club ("VWC") in Shanghai, becoming a pioneer in bringing professional training, education, and awareness of Olympic weightlifting to a broader Chinese audience. VWC quickly gained recognition for its innovative approach and international Olympic standards. It is the official partner of the Chinese Weightlifting Association, a national industry association. [Exhibit E-1: Introduction of VWC]

Ms. Yaruo Qu cooperated with several Olympic medalists and offered a comprehensive training system named Body Alignment Training ("BAT") and successfully commercialized it over VWC's official website and third-party platforms including trainheroic.com and thinkific.com. [Exhibit E-2: Course Materials on Official Website, YouTube, & Third-Party Platforms] The courses have received wide acclaim in the market, praised for their creativity, structured curriculum, and tangible results. It has received 100,000 page views and thousands of orders. They have attracted a diverse group of participants, ranging from beginners to seasoned practitioners, and have contributed to raising public awareness and appreciation of weightlifting. [Exhibit E-3: Sales Records of the Courses] In addition, VWC entered into a cooperation with Shanghai Jing'an No. 2 Youth Amateur Sports School for the training courses, integrating the program into the school's curriculum, broadening the program's reach and marking a significant step toward youth development and early engagement in weightlifting. [Exhibit E-4: Cooperation Agreement with Shanghai Jing'an No. 2 Youth Amateur Sports School]

Many trainees in the BAT system have achieved certifications, competitive successes, and, most importantly, long-term physical benefits following the training sessions. For instance, Ms. Cassandra Lau, a Singapore national weightlifter, testified in her letter that Ms. Qu's BAT training has helped her "develop better mobility and stability" and refined her techniques pain-free. Specifically, she explained that,

> "her system integrates body alignment principles with weightlifting performance, providing a framework that not only enhances strength but also prevents injuries... By the end of 2024, I was selected as a national weightlifting athlete after competing in my country's national competition. Gaby's guidance played a pivotal role in my ability to reach this level, and her training principles continue to shape my progress as an athlete." [Exhibit E-5: Recommendation Letter from Cassandra Lau]

Mr. Muhammad Hj Kamit, a national weightlifter from Brunei, also states that he has significantly benefited from the BAT system. He detailed that,

> "Unlike conventional training methods, which focus purely on strength and technique, BAT taught me how to move efficiently and eliminate the root cause of my limitations. Gaby's coaching wasn't about temporary fixes - it was about building a foundation for long-term successes."

Then he detailed several significant improvements he benefited from the BAT system. [Exhibit E-6: Recommendation Letter from Muhammd Hi Kamit]

Ms. Qu's BAT system has not only been widely commended by the general public, credible agencies, and professional individuals, but also been systematically employed in the training of national and international weightlifting teams by renowned weightlifting coaches. Mr. Siem Hauw Kiauw Jeffry, the President of the Indonesian Weightlifting Federation East Java Province ("PABSI"), highly appreciates Ms. Qu's BAT system and clearly illustrates the originality and functionality of the system by stating,

> "Coach Gaby's Body Alignment Training methods creatively emphasize the importance of proper alignment and functionality in athletic training to prevent overuse injuries. Different from traditional weightlifting training focusing just on strength, mobility, or power alone, it integrates a comprehensive approach by focusing on body alignment and functionality proactively, implementing a structured, three-layer progression: elasticity with resistance for body-weight power, strength with resistance for core stability, and alignment and space restoration for rebalancing the body. It significantly contributed to the athletes' precision level and body-weight power, core stability through resistance, and sustainable growth." [Exhibit B-1: Letter of Support from Mr. Siem Hauw Kiauw Jeffry]

Likewise, business partners of Venus Weightlifting and Ms. Qu, all highly recognized the originality of the BAT system and its wide application in the programs they hosted with Ms. Qu. These industry leaders include, but are not limited to:

In addition to creating and developing her BAT training system, Ms. Qu has founded the first weightlifting club in China to successfully commercialize the system and effectively apply the training methods in the practice of both the general public and professional athletes in their respective training routines, both domestically and internationally. Therefore, Ms. Qu has made original contributions of major significance to the field, as required under 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(viii). In addition, she has contributed as an industry pioneer and is among the select few who have reached the pinnacle of the weightlifting training industry. Her leadership, vision, and hands-on involvement have not only advanced professional standards but also inspired a new generation of practitioners globally. Through her work, she continues to shape the development of the industry, bridging global best practices with local innovation.

### IV. Ms. Qu's Performance as a Leading and Critical Role for Organizations or Establishments that Have a Distinguished Reputation

Ms. Qu has served in a leading and critical role for two distinguished organizations, namely Ishtar Health Pte. Ltd. ("Ishtar Health") and Shanghai Yiqing Fitness Management Co. Ltd. ("Shanghai Yiqing").

Established in 2015, Shanghai Yiqing is an AAA credit-rated industry-leading company specializing in fitness and leisure activities, with a special focus on weightlifting training and related events hosting. Yaruo Qu has been the legal representative, founder, substantial shareholder, and actual controller of the company. [Exhibit F-1: Business License, Certificate of Enterprise with AAA credit rating, Company Information in the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, Aiqicha.com, and Qcc.com]

As the top leader of Shanghai Yiqing, Ms. Yaruo Qu established the Venus Weightlifting Club and led Shanghai Yiqing in sponsoring and organizing major industry events for consecutive years, significantly strengthening its brand and visibility. These sustained efforts positioned the club as a recognized authority within the industry. For instance, soon after the establishment of Shanghai Yiqing, Ms. Qu led Shanghai Yiqing entering into cooperations with multiple key industry leaders and organized the 2nd Shanghai Citizen's Games and the 2017 to 2019 "Venus Weightlifting Cup" competitions. [Exhibit F-2: Cooperation and Sponsorship Agreements] These events have been widely acclaimed by the general public, mainstream newspapers, and authoritative government agencies. The General Administration of Sport of China published an article acclaiming that more than 5,000,000 people participated in the $2^{nd}$ Shanghai Citizen's Games. Likewise, the China Weightlifting Association published an article highlighting the grand event of 2017 "Venus Weightlifting Cup" Weightlifting and Physical Fitness Challenge, stating that it attracted almost 300 athletes from ten countries. The article also emphasized that the Venus Weightlifting Club helped popularize weightlifting and played a key role in changing public misconceptions about the sport. [Exhibit F-3: Press Releases about the 2nd Shanghai Citizen's Games & the 2017 "Venus Weightlifting Cup"]

In its reply to the Venus Weightlifting Club, the China Weightlifting Association also acclaimed that,

> "The event to be organized by your Club will play a positive role in driving forward national strength training and promoting people's physical health." [Exhibit F-4: China Weightlifting Association's Reply]

China Weightlifting Association is the authoritative weightlifting association affiliated with the All-China Sports Federation, aiming to enhance weightlifting practice at the national level. [Exhibit F-5: Introduction of China Weightlifting Association]

Building on the successes of holding grand industry events, which significantly elevated Shanghai Yiqing and the Venus Weightlifting Club's influence and visibility, Ms. Qu recognized the growing international interest in her training model. With a solid reputation established at home and increasing global engagement, Shanghai Yiqing launched its first overseas branch - Ishtar Health Pte. Ltd. ("Ishtar Health") in Singapore, aiming to share its proven methods, foster cross-cultural exchange, and bring the spirit of Venus Weightlifting Club to a broader international audience.

In April 2023, Ms. Qu co-founded Ishtar Health in Singapore, serving as its Head Coach. She has played a critical role in the company's training program development and innovation, professional network expansion and industry collaborations, development of global seminars, coach mentorship and management, and international collaboration. Specifically, she effectively integrated BAT techniques into Ishtar's training programs. In addition, she established professional networks on behalf of Ishtar Health with national and regional weightlifting federations, including the Singapore Weightlifting Federation. In the letter, Ishtar Health especially states that:

> "One of her most notable contributions was facilitating ISHTAR's connection with the Singapore Weightlifting Federation. Through her efforts, Ishtar built strong partnerships that enhanced its credibility and positioned it as a key player in the weightlifting education space. These connections also provided ISHTAR opportunities to host seminars, participate in key weightlifting industry events, attract athletes, coaches, and fitness professionals from around the world, and contribute to the development of Singapore's weightlifting community." [Exhibit F-6: Company Letter by Ishtar Health]

Ms. Kylie Siu Ka Fai, the Director at Thrive Healthcare Pte Ltd ("Thrive Health"), also provides a Recommendation Letter illustrating Ms. Qu's leading role in Ishtar Health and the company's distinguished reputation. As a leading organization in the field of sports rehabilitation in Singapore, Thrive Healthcare has established cooperation with Ishtar Health. [Exhibit F-7: Service Agreement with Thrive Healthcare; Exhibit F-8: Service Agreement with Thrive Healthcare]

Ms. Fai has gained knowledge of Ms. Qu's expertise and leadership at Ishtar Health through a joint project. She concludes that Ms. Qu has advanced Ishtar Health by driving technical innovation, integrating interdisciplinary knowledge, optimizing systems, expanding global collaboration and influence, gaining industry recognition and authority, and increasing public impact through social media. Specifically, Ms. Fai states in the letter,

> "She has demonstrated exceptional leadership and professional expertise in multiple projects we have collaborated on... We began working with Ms. Gaby in September 2023 on a project aimed at promoting professional weightlifting coaching in Singapore. Ms. Gaby has been the driving force and leader behind the project, serving as a core weightlifting expert. Her unique perspective and professional knowledge have provided us with invaluable support." [Exhibit F-8: Recommendation Letter from Thrive Healthcare]

Rx Performance listed Venus Weightlifting as its owner on its official website, claiming Venus Weightlifting to be "Shanghai's first and only premier weightlifting facility". [Exhibit F-9: Online Introduction of the Venus Weightlifting, Courses & Marketing Documents] On the Singapore Weightlifting Federation, Rx Performance was listed as a business partner of SWF. SWF is a National Sports Association under the purview of the Singapore Sports Council. [Exhibit F-10: List of Rx Performance as Business Partner on SWF's Official Website & Introduction of SWF]

Therefore, Ms. Qu has also performed a leading and critical role within Shanghai Yiqing and Ishtar Health, two of the most reputable enterprises in the weightlifting training industry, and has clearly met the plain language of 8 C.F.R. §204.5(h)(3)(viii). Her eminence and position as one of the few who have reached the very top of the weightlifting training industry have been widely recognized by peers, business partners, industry associations, and major media. Her outstanding performance has had a profound impact, extending well beyond the two institutions to the entire weightlifting training industry.

## PART TWO: OVERALL MERITS

When evaluated under the totality of circumstances, Ms. Qu has established that she is among the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of her field- weightlifting training.

* The submitted evidence in Exhibit C demonstrates that Ms. Qu is a member of the Shanghai Fitness Bodybuilding Association a prestigious industry association requiring its members to provide the most outstanding credentials to be qualified.
* The submitted evidence in Exhibit D demonstrates that Ms. Qu's eminence in weightlifting training has been widely recognized not only by major domestic media but also by prominent regional media such as The Jakarta Post, a leading national newspaper published in Indonesia. This broad media coverage underscores her influence in the field and highlights the widespread acknowledgment of her contributions across multiple regions.
* The submitted evidence in Exhibit E demonstrates that Ms. Qu has made original contributions to weightlifting training by inventing the BAT system and successfully commercializing and applying it on a regional scale, not only within China but also in Indonesia, Singapore, and other countries across Asia.
* The submitted evidence in Exhibit F demonstrates that Ms. Qu has been a successful entrepreneur as a weightlifting instructor, having not only taken a leading role in Shanghai Yiqing and Thrive Healthcare but also successfully integrated the BAT system into institutional training curricula and established connections on a regional scale with multiple national weightlifting associations. Her leadership has contributed to the standardization of training methodologies and the promotion of advanced techniques across diverse athletic communities and numerous amateur weightlifting practitioners.

We further provide supplemental objective evidence in this section regarding her top status as a weightlifting trainer as below.

In 2023, she obtained the First Prize of the Achievement Award in the Fitness Industry in China, granted by the Research Center for Basic Education Curriculum Reform of the Ministry of Education of China. The award attests to her nationally recognized expertise and continued involvement at the highest levels of the field of weightlifting training. [Exhibit G-1: Award Certificate of Achievement Award in the Fitness Industry in China & Official Award List on the Award Organizer's Official Website]

Ms. Qu's contributions have also been recognized through multiple independent invitations to speak at academic institutions, including but not limited to the Institute of Technical Education ("ITE") College Central in Singapore, KEDGE Business School Chinese Alumni Association in France, and Shandong Taishan Management Training School in China. These prestigious institutions recognized Ms. Qu as an outstanding entrepreneur, educator, and role model, and in addition, the Venus Weightlifting Club and Body Alignment Training system established by her have prominent international influence and performance. [Exhibit G-2: Invitation from the ITE College Central; Exhibit G-3: Invitation from KEDGE; Exhibit G-4: Invitation from Shandong Taishan Management Training School] As a prestigious academic institution in Singapore, ITE College Central once received a speech by the Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien LOONG.

[Exhibit G-3: Profile of KEDGE Business School; Exhibit G-4: Profile of Shandong Taishan Management Training School] These speaking engagements serve as further evidence of her role as a subject matter expert whose insights are sought by professional and educational audiences. The fact that these institutions invited her independently, based on her reputation and expertise, supports the conclusion that she is regarded as a leading authority in weightlifting training and education.

Ms. Qu's influence extends to the commercial domain. She has been selected as a brand ambassador by Optinum Nutrition and invited to collaborate with a luxury brand - LVMH. These engagements typically involve individuals with substantial public visibility, a high level of professional distinction, and high impacts in their respective fields. It also corroborates the statement that Ms. Qu has successfully commercialized weightlifting training and her unique BAT system in China through her persistent endeavors.

## PART THREE: MS. QU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN THE U.S. IN HER CLAIMED AREA OF EXPERTISE.

Ms. Qu plans to work in the United States with her extraordinary ability in weightlifting training as a Weightlifting Instructor. [Exhibit H-1: Ms. Yaruo Qu's Career Plan]

Ms. Qu has analyzed the U.S. weightlifting fitness industry and determined to establish a training academy in Dallas, Texas, and plans to promote her Body Alignment Training program globally. The academy will cooperate with Olympic gold medalist Mr. Xiaojun Lyu to teach weightlifting techniques and strength training courses covering beginner to advanced levels, promote coach certification and continuing education programs, as well as regular training camps and competitions held at least twice a year. The academy will partner with local CrossFit clubs, industry associations, international trainers, and athletes to promote its influence in the United States. In addition, Ms. Qu will engage with the local community by organizing public seminars, industry summits, and training programs, collaborating with local medical institutions and physical therapists to jointly develop specialized rehabilitation and injury prevention systems, and conducting research on the integration and application of traditional Chinese corrective exercise techniques with modern sports training. [Exhibit H-1: Career Plan]

Ms. Qu has obtained the necessary professional certifications to work in her field within the United States. Specifically, she holds a U.S. coaching certification, which demonstrates that she has met the standards required to provide professional weightlifting instruction in accordance with recognized national guidelines. [Exhibit H-2: USA Weightlifting Coach Certification, Online Membership Page & Confirmation Email] In addition, her active membership in the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), one of the leading professional organizations in the field, further confirms her qualifications with industry best practices in the U.S., as well as her proposed commitment to collaborate with other professionals to promote weightlifting training. [Exhibit H-3: NSCA Professional Membership Certificate]

Ms. Qu's intent to immigrate to the United States will blend advanced weightlifting training expertise with entrepreneurial initiatives and cultural engagement. Specifically, her immigration will benefit the United States to the extent that she will:

1.  Raise the professional standards of strength and education in the U.S., develop safe and effective rehabilitation and injury prevention protocols for trainees, and improve trainees' health conditions. This can help elevate American competitiveness in international weightlifting events, including the Olympic and World Championships.
2.  Foster grassroots participation in weightlifting, a strength and Olympic sport with proven health benefits, to support public health objectives. Through training and outreach, Ms. Qu can help combat chronic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, etc. These conditions collectively cost the U.S. trillions of dollars each year, and Ms. Qu offers an effective, evidence-based approach to prevention and long-term health improvement by developing and promoting her Body Alignment Training System.
3.  Create job opportunities by establishing her weightlifting training academy and holding academic seminars and industry summits. These initiatives would stimulate local economies by employing coaches, athletic trainers, administrative staff, and event coordinators, while also attracting participants, sponsors, and collaborators from across the country.
4.  Promote cross-cultural exchanges in the weightlifting training industry by highlighting the integration of Eastern and Western training philosophies, including traditional Chinese corrective techniques and modern sports science.

## PART FOUR: STANDARD OF EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSION

The standard of proof for an EB-1A petition is the "preponderance of the evidence," meaning the petitioner must show that the claim is "more likely than not" to be true. See Matter of Martinez, 21 I&N Dec. 1035 (BIA 1997); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 774 (BIA 1988); Matter of SooHoo, 11 I&N Dec. 151 (BIA 1965). Under the final merits determination articulated in Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010), the Service must consider all submitted evidence in its totality. In this case, we have provided extensive documentation clearly satisfying at least four of the ten regulatory criteria under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3) and further demonstrating that Ms. Yaruo Qu meets the overall standard of extraordinary ability. Accordingly, we respectfully submit that the evidence not only meets but exceeds the required standard of proof and fully supports a favorable determination under both the regulatory criteria and the final merits analysis.

In conclusion, the foregoing cited evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrates that Ms. Qu has sustained national acclaim and had her achievements recognized in the field of weightlifting training and instruction, and it demonstrates that she is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. Furthermore, she also manifests detailed plans to continue work in her area of extraordinary ability upon entry to the U.S. Clearly, these plans, utilizing her extraordinary ability, would prospectively provide substantial benefit to the United States of America. We appreciate your time and consideration of this important matter and respectfully request that your office favorably adjudicate this petition.

Thank you!
Very truly yours,
